## test: Unit Tests ##

These are two unit tests. One for testing the collision identification (5 test cases) and one for testing the identification of user input (4 test cases).  
Bot of these tests have succeeded.  
These unit tests can run directly in rars as they were also written in RISC-V assembly. The output can be seen in the console.
